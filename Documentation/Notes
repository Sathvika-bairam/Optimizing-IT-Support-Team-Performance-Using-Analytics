# Week-1
- Self Introduction
-Explanation about project like Customers transaction issues that fetching customer details or  transaction of money is delay due to processing then it is a Ticket issue
 so, Ticket is raised by Customer such as fetching amount is not convenient 
- introduction to power bi
  * ribbon
  * Power Query
  * Visual View
  * Table View
  * Model View
- Extracting dataset from different websites
- Data cleaning in power Query of Power bi
  * Removing Duplicates
  * In a column data is 80% then remaining is null then fill with aggregation
  * Removing unnessary columns
  * Standardizing each column
  * Rearranging columns
  * Replace values
  * Removing White Spaces : Trim
  * Removing Special characters : RV
  * Delimeter :  To Split columns 

# Task : Extract and Clean dataset in Power bi using Power Query


# Week-2
- In Second week i shown my cleaned dataset
- Vs Code Setup and how files and folders are created
- how to use ipynb file and what is dataframe, uses of pandas library
   * Dataframe : is a table with rows and columns that helps us store, clean, and analyze data easily in python
   * Pandas : to load datasets into vscode (excel , csv files) and helps to handles tables
- commands used
  # importing libraries
- import pandas as pd
  # loading dataset
- df = df.read_csv(r"Customer_call_list.csv")
- df
  #drop duplicates
- df.drop_duplicates()
  # removing white spaces
- df["last_name"] = df["last_name"].str.strip()
  # removing Special characters
- df["last_name"] = df["last_name"].str.strip("/._")
  # Replace Values
- df["Paying Customer"] = df["Paying Customer"].str.replace("Yes","Y")
- df["Paying Customer"] = df["Paying Customer"].str.replace("No","N")
- df["Do_Not_Contact"] = df["Do_Not_Contact"].str.replace("Yes","Y")
- df["Do_Not_Contact"] = df["Do_Not_Contact"].str.replace("No","N")
- df
  # removing unnecessary rows
- df=df[df["Do_Not_Contact"] !="Y"]
- df
  # droping unnecessary columns
- df = df.drop(columns=["Not_Useful_Column"])
- df = df.drop(columns = ["Unnamed: 8"])
- df = df.drop(columns = ["Unnamed: 9"])
- df
  # fill null with empty values
- df=df.fillna("")
- df
  # remove empty values rows of phone number
- df= df[df["Phone_Number"] !=""]
- df
  # remove empty values rows of last name
- df= df[df["Last_Name"] !=""]
- df
 # reset index
- df= df.reset_index()
- df
 # drop index column
- df= df.drop(columns = ["index"])
- df
 # rename column
- df = df.rename(columns={"Paying Customer":"Paying_Customer"})
- df
# Task : to work with customer call list dataset


# Week-3
- introduction to EDA
   * EDA stands for Exploratory data analytics and it is a process of exploring, understanding, and summerizing
     data before creating dashboards
   * EDA helps to find insights, patterns, problems and stories hidden in data
   * Without EDA : dashboards become just charts
   * With EDA : dashboards answer business questions
- Factors of EDA
   * volume of data
   * distribution of data
   * comparison
   * Relationships
- Framing questions by analysing dataset for dashboards
# Task : reviews


# week-4 
- Importing live data
  * through get data - web - pasting url of dataset(basic) - then connect
-  while import live data and getting updtes daily causing flooding to avoid this we use big Servers , google has big server
  * w3 school dataset is public and connected with power bi
  * nsestocks dataset this site is procted and doesnot allow tools(restrict tools like power bi, excel,bot and scrapper)
  * But to access we need to have either API key or Organisation account
- API End Point : is a place(URL) where a computer goes to get data
  * website for humans
  * API endpoint for computer
- Zendesk is customer support tool
  companies use it to: 
  * collect customer problems(ticket)
  * Assign ticket to support agents
  * Track status(pending,sloved)
  * measure performance(response time)
 - example: order is late - create a ticket in zendesk
 - creating the Github repository
# Task : creating repository


# week-5
- What is KPI
  KPI stands for key performance indicator and it is a measurable value that tells us how somthing well performed compared to a goal 
-The different datatypes available in dataset, those are
*continuous data 
*categorical data
*time based data
- continuous data :  is a numerical data where we can perform mathematical operations like meann ,median and mode etc...
  and also to visualize this plots we use cards and histogram plot , cards shows numerical value and histogram wrok on ranges
- categorical data : is a data thta divides into groups like males and females of gender data
and also to visualize this data we use bar plot and pie chart , bar plot is used to compare between categories and pie chart is
used to represent the categories in percentages.
- time based data : time based data means values varying over time or duration example gold price may decreases or increases completely 
varying day by day . And to visualize this plot we use line plot because line plot implies a sequence.
-we learnt what is primary and foreign key 
* primary key : it is a column in table that contains unique values and doesnot contain null and duplicate values
* foreign key : it is a column in table that refer to primary key of another table
- we understand what is fact and dimension table 
* fact table : it contains the main metrics of data
* dimension table : it contains complete details of customers and produts
* next we establish connnection between tables  through primary key and observed relation between table as
 * 1 to many(*)
 * many to 1
- next we took sales example in powerbi 
* we observed how tables are connnected to each other and relation among the tables.

Task : find out which is primary and foreign key in fact and dimension table
   -  A fact table doesnot contain single primary key, instead we use composite primary key , it is combination of
      both customerid and productid.
   -  Here customerid and productid  are columns in fact table refering to customerid of dimension table ,productid of
      dimension table with respectively.
