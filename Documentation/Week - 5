- What is KPI
  KPI stands for key performance indicator and it is a measurable value that tells us how somthing well performed compared to a goal 
- what are the different data available in datasets, those are
*continuous data 
*categorical data
*time based data
- continuous data :  is a numerical data where we can perform mathematical operations like mean ,median and mode etc...
  and also to visualize this plots we use cards and histogram plot , cards shows numerical value and histogram wrok on ranges
- categorical data : is a data thta divides into groups like males and females of gender data
and also to visualize this data we use bar plot and pie chart , bar plot is used to compare between categories and pie chart is
used to represent the categories in percentages.
- time based data : time based data means values varying over time or duration example gold price may decreases or increases completely 
varying day by day . And to visualize this plot we use line plot because line plot implies a sequence.
-we learnt what is primary and foreign key 
* primary key : it is a column in table that contains unique values and doesnot contain null and duplicate values
* foreign key : it is a column in table that refer to primary key of another table
- we understand what is fact and dimension table 
* fact table : it contains the main metrics of data
* dimension table : it contains complete details of customers and produts
* next we establish connnection between tables  through primary key and observed relation between table as
 * 1 to many(*)
 * many to 1
- next we took sales example in powerbi 
* we observed how tables are connnected to each other and relation among the tables.

Task : find out which is primary and foreign key in fact and dimension table
   -  A fact table doesnot contain single primary key, instead we use composite primary key , it is combination of
      both customerid and productid.
   -  Here customerid and productid  are columns in fact table refering to customerid of dimension table ,productid of
      dimension table with respectively.
