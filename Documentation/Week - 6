# Week- 6
- what is DAX?
 DAX stands for data analysis expression and it is used to create Measures, Calculated Columns and Tables
- fact table mean : it contains measurable data
In powerbi summation stands for measurable column
- From sales dataset we learned DAX formula's:
    Total Profit = Sum(FactSales[Profit])
- Power bi has in built functions those are sum, avg, std etc these are implict functions and we can perform 
operations by using that function but problem is implict function don't have control over data
- Explict functions : the columns that are created by using DAX formulas and by using Dax formula we can change
columns, modification of values.
-differnce between Revenue and Profit 
 Revenue: All the money company earns by selling.
 Profit: Money left after paying all expenses
- Base Measure: It is a measure created using column from table
- Composite measure: it is a column created using combining the two measures columns.
- filter is a Dax function that returns a table with rows if given condition is satisfied. 
   filter is used inside CALCULATE() to apply row level conditions for result
- Formula :Total profits from manager = 
                         CALCULATE(
                         [Total Profit],
                         DimEmployee[Role] = 'manager'
                         DimDate[year] = 2018
                         )
- If Condition Formula:
            Target = if(
                     [Total Revenue] > 2000000,
                     "Target Reached",
                     "failed"
                      )
